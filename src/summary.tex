You have a job that needs doing. Are you ready, or do you shy away because of impact?\\
I strive for real, stable progress, and I would like an agile team that does as well.\\[5pt]
If we are realistic about our expectations, you will find my enthusiasm, resourcefulness, and dogged determination an asset. I excel at learning whatever is best for the task at hand.\\[5pt]
